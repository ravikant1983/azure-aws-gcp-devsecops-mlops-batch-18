## 1. What is a Computer?

A **computer** is an electronic machine that:

* Takes **input** (keyboard, mouse)
* **Processes** it using a processor (CPU)
* Produces **output** (monitor, display)

### Components of a Computer

* **Hardware**: Physical parts that you can see and touch

  * Cabinet
  * Keyboard
  * Mouse
  * Monitor
  * Processor (e.g., i9)
* **Software**: Programs or applications that run on hardware

  * Operating System
  * Applications (Netflix, Chatbot, etc.)

**Formula:**

> Computer = Hardware + Software

---

## 2. Operating System (OS)

An **Operating System** is a software that:

* Provides a **User Interface (UI)**
* Manages hardware resources
* Acts as a bridge between **user** and **hardware**

### Types of Computers (Based on OS)

* Windows Computer
* Linux Computer
* Mac Computer

---

## 3. Kernel – The Heart of the Operating System

The **Kernel** is the core part of an operating system.

### Role of Kernel

* Acts as a bridge between **hardware** and **software**
* Communicates with:

  * Keyboard
  * Mouse
  * Disk
  * CPU
* Controls memory, processes, and device drivers

> **Kernel = Heart of the Operating System**

### Examples of Kernels

* Windows Kernel
* Linux Kernel
* Mac Kernel

---

## 4. History of Operating Systems

### UNIX Kernel

* Developed by **IBM in 1970**

### Windows Kernel

* Introduced around **1980**
* Examples: Windows 98, XP
* **Closed Source**

### Linux Kernel

* Created in **1990**
* Developed by **Linus Torvalds**
* **Open Source**

---

## 5. Open Source vs Closed Source

### Closed Source

* Source code is not visible
* Managed by companies (e.g., Microsoft)

### Open Source

* Source code is publicly visible
* Community-driven
* Hosted mainly on **GitHub**

> **Source = Code**
> **Source Code Management = Git**

🔹 **Git technology was also created by Linus Torvalds**

---

## 6. Linux Explained Clearly

### Important Concept

> **Linux itself is a Kernel, not a full OS**

### Linux Operating System is made of:

* Kernel
* GUI (Graphical User Interface)
* System Software & Tools

**Formula:**

> Kernel + GUI + System Software = Linux Operating System

---

## 7. Application Deployment Requirement

### Requirement

* A **Linux computer** is required
* Middleware installation is needed

### Middleware Example

* **Nginx Web Server**

### Deployment Steps

1. Get a Linux machine
2. Install Nginx web server
3. Download application code from GitHub
4. Copy code to required directory (folder)
5. Run application

---

## 8. Applications Discussed

* Netflix
* Chatbot

### Question:

Where can these applications run?

### Answer:

They can run on:

* Local Computer
* Cloud Platforms

---

## 9. Cloud Platforms Overview

### Major Cloud Providers

* **AWS** (Amazon Web Services)
* **Azure** (Microsoft)
* **GCP** (Google Cloud Platform)

---

## 10. Cloud Service Models

### IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service

* Full control over VM
* Example Services:

  * AWS EC2
  * Azure VM
  * GCP Compute Engine

### PaaS – Platform as a Service

* Platform managed by cloud
* Developer focuses on code
* Examples:

  * AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  * Azure Web Apps
  * GCP App Engine

---

## 11. Compute & Scaling Services Comparison

### AWS

* EC2
* Auto Scaling Group
* EKS (Kubernetes)
* Lambda Functions

### Azure

* VM
* VMSS (Virtual Machine Scale Set)
* AKS (Kubernetes)
* Azure Functions

### GCP

* Compute Engine
* Instance Group
* Kubernetes Engine
* Cloud Functions

## 12. Key Takeaways / Recap

* Kernel is the most important part of an OS
* Linux is a kernel; OS is built on top of it
* Open source drives modern DevOps & Cloud
* GitHub is the hub of open-source code
* Cloud provides multiple ways to run applications
* Linux is the backbone of cloud & DevOps
